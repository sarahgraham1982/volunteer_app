# Volunteer App 

An app for incentivising volunteers with tangible discounts and rewards. During the pandemic, charities saw a decrease in volunteers, charity shops were closed and there was an increase in the need for charities such as Womens Aid and Domestic Abuse charities. We created a brand new concept in volunteering apps that does not currently exist with the goal of increasing volunteer numbers.
